## **üß† SERENA MCP KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION**

### **Knowledge Base Categories:**
Use Serena MCP memory system to prevent repeated failed optimizations and build cumulative intelligence:

**Before Each Analysis - Check Previous Attempts:**
```bash
# Review what's been tried before
mcp__serena__read_memory("optimization_attempts")      # Complete attempt history
mcp__serena__read_memory("failed_optimizations")       # Anti-pattern database  
mcp__serena__read_memory("parameter_experiments")      # Parameter tuning history
mcp__serena__read_memory("strategic_decisions")        # Decision rationale archive
mcp__serena__read_memory("iteration_patterns")         # Cross-iteration patterns
mcp__serena__read_memory("competitive_analysis")       # Market intelligence
```

**After Each Analysis - Update Knowledge Base:**
```bash
# Store new insights for future iterations
mcp__serena__write_memory("optimization_attempts", "
Iteration #X: [Date]
Approach: [ROI threshold adjustment 150% ‚Üí 175%] 
Result: SUCCESS - +18% growth improvement
Performance Impact: ‚Ç¨450,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¨531,000 company value
Lessons: ROI 175% optimal for Phase 1, avoid going >180%
")

mcp__serena__write_memory("failed_optimizations", "
ANTI-PATTERN: ROI thresholds above 200%
Tried in: Iterations #2, #5, #7
Result: Route construction rate drops >60%, net profit decreases
Root Cause: Overly selective criteria creates route scarcity
Recommendation: AVOID ROI >180%, focus on route quality instead
")
```

### **Knowledge Base Memory Categories:**

1. **optimization_attempts**: Complete registry of all attempts (successful + failed)
2. **failed_optimizations**: Anti-pattern database - what consistently fails  
3. **parameter_experiments**: ROI thresholds, distance limits, production requirements tested
4. **strategic_decisions**: Decision rationale - WHY certain approaches were chosen
5. **iteration_patterns**: Success/failure patterns identified across iterations
6. **competitive_analysis**: Market intelligence and competitor behavior insights

**üéØ CRITICAL**: Always check knowledge base BEFORE planning new optimizations to avoid repeating failed attempts!

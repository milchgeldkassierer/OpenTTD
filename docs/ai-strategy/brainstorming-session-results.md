#### Ideas Generated:
1. API-based industry scanning for coal/ore/gold sources
2. Town/industry cargo acceptance verification via API
3. Construction cost calculation per tile
4. ROI calculation: (Annual Revenue - Operating Costs) / Construction Cost
5. Route ranking system by ROI performance
6. Terrain cost analysis integration
7. Straight-line distance optimization
8. Production rate validation for sustainable routes

#### Insights Discovered:
- API provides all necessary data for intelligent route selection
- ROI-based ranking creates objective decision framework
- Construction cost analysis prevents expensive terrain mistakes
- Production rate checking ensures sustainable long-term routes

#### Notable Connections:
- API data + ROI calculation = Data-driven route decisions
- Terrain analysis + construction costs = Accurate investment calculations
- Production rates + revenue estimates = Reliable profit projections

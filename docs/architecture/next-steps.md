# Next Steps

After completing this backend architecture:

## For Development Implementation:
1. **Begin AI Development:** Use the AI Developer Guide with this architecture as reference
2. **Setup Development Environment:** Follow development-environment.md specifications
3. **Implement Components:** Start with FinanceManager and PerformanceLogger for Iteration #1
4. **Execute Testing:** Use test-execution-guide.md procedures with standardized scenarios

## For System Architecture:
1. **Review Architecture Completeness:** Validate all components and interfaces are defined
2. **Setup Knowledge Base:** Initialize Serena MCP memory system for optimization tracking
3. **Prepare Analysis Pipeline:** Create bash scripts for log analysis and metric extraction

## Next Agent Handoffs:
1. **AI Developer:** Begin Iteration #1 implementation using this architecture
2. **Analytics Developer:** Setup analysis tools and knowledge base management

**Architecture Completion:** This document provides the complete technical foundation for implementing the Ultimate OpenTTD AI system with its iterative optimization methodology. All components, interfaces, data models, and workflows are defined to support the BUILD → TEST → MEASURE → ANALYZE → OPTIMIZE → REPEAT cycle.

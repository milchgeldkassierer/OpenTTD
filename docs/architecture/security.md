# Security

Security requirements for the embedded OpenTTD AI system focus on data integrity and safe operation within the game environment.

## Input Validation
- **Validation Library:** Custom Squirrel validation functions
- **Validation Location:** All OpenTTD API data inputs before processing
- **Required Rules:**
  - All OpenTTD API results MUST be validated before use
  - Validate data types and ranges for financial calculations
  - Sanitize all data used in logging to prevent log corruption

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Auth Method:** N/A (embedded single-user system)
- **Session Management:** N/A (no user sessions)
- **Required Patterns:**
  - No authentication required for embedded AI system
  - Access control handled by OpenTTD game engine

## Secrets Management
- **Development:** No secrets required (all data from game engine)
- **Production:** No secrets required (self-contained system)
- **Code Requirements:**
  - No hardcoded configuration values
  - All parameters via game engine or configuration files
  - No sensitive data in logs (only game performance metrics)

## API Security
- **Rate Limiting:** N/A (OpenTTD manages execution cycles)
- **CORS Policy:** N/A (no web interfaces)
- **Security Headers:** N/A (no HTTP communication)
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** N/A (local system only)

## Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest:** N/A (game performance data only)
- **Encryption in Transit:** N/A (no network communication)
- **PII Handling:** No personal information processed
- **Logging Restrictions:** Only log game state and AI decisions, no personal data

## Dependency Security
- **Scanning Tool:** Manual review of Squirrel code dependencies
- **Update Policy:** Follow OpenTTD stable releases
- **Approval Process:** Manual review of any external Squirrel libraries

## Security Testing
- **SAST Tool:** Manual code review for input validation
- **DAST Tool:** N/A (no external interfaces)
- **Penetration Testing:** N/A (embedded system)

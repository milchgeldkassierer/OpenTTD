# Knowledge Base Requirements for Ultimate OpenTTD AI

## Overview
Critical gap identified: Need systematic knowledge base to prevent Analytics Developer from repeating failed optimizations and to build cumulative intelligence across iterations.

## Serena MCP Integration
Using Serena's memory system for persistent knowledge storage across development cycles.

## Required Memory Categories

### 1. Optimization Attempt Registry
**Memory: `optimization_attempts`**
- Complete history of all optimization attempts (successful + failed)
- Format: Attempt ID, Date, Type, Objective, Implementation, Result, Impact, Lessons
- Searchable by type, result, performance impact

### 2. Failed Optimization Database  
**Memory: `failed_optimizations`**
- Anti-pattern database - what consistently fails
- Critical for preventing repeated mistakes
- Format: Failed approach, Why it failed, Conditions tried, Alternative approaches

### 3. Parameter Experiment History
**Memory: `parameter_experiments`**  
- Complete history of parameter tuning (ROI thresholds, distance limits, etc.)
- Success/failure patterns for parameter combinations
- Optimal ranges and danger zones identified

### 4. Strategic Decision History
**Memory: `strategic_decisions`**
- Decision rationale database - WHY certain approaches chosen
- Options considered, trade-offs analyzed, outcomes achieved
- Critical for maintaining strategic continuity

### 5. Cross-Iteration Patterns
**Memory: `iteration_patterns`**
- Success patterns that work across multiple iterations  
- Failure patterns that consistently emerge
- Conditional patterns (what works when)

### 6. Competitive Intelligence
**Memory: `competitive_analysis`**
- Market analysis patterns and insights
- Competitor behavior observations
- Successful counter-strategies

## Analytics Developer Workflow Integration
1. **Before Analysis**: Read relevant memories to understand previous attempts
2. **During Analysis**: Cross-reference current findings with historical patterns
3. **After Optimization**: Update memories with new insights and outcomes
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends across stored knowledge

## Benefits
- Prevent repeated failed optimizations
- Build cumulative intelligence across iterations
- Accelerate optimization through historical learning
- Maintain strategic continuity across development cycles

## Success Metrics
- Reduced repeated optimization attempts
- Faster convergence to optimal strategies  
- Improved Analytics Developer decision quality
- Accelerated overall AI performance improvement
